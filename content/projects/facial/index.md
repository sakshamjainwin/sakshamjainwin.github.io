This repository showcases an award-winning implementation of Facial Expression Recognition (FER) using deep learning techniques. The project includes models built with a Custom CNN Architecture and ResNet-50, along with real-time emotion detection capabilities. The models classify facial expressions into seven categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral. The dataset used is the FER-2013 dataset.
