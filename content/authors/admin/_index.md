I’m Saksham Jain, a 3rd-year B.Tech student at DTU. I recently worked with MIT CSAIL (#1 AI Lab in world), where I built LLM-based agent workflows to generate knowledge graphs and extract structured insights from messy, unstructured text. I also have a first-author publication at IJCNN 2025 (presented in Rome!). I love working with GenAI/LLMs: RAG pipelines, agentic systems, vector DBs, and training/evaluation frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow). I’ve shipped projects end-to-end, including deployment on AWS/GCP.
